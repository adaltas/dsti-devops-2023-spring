## Objectives

1. Quickstart with Istio
2. Route requests
3. Traffic shifting (canary rollout)

## Before starting

1. Install Minikube and start a Kubernetes cluster

After Minikube installation run:

- `minikube config set driver docker`
- `minikube start --memory=16384 --cpus=4 --kubernetes-version=v1.20.2`
- `minikube tunnel`

> **Note!** If you **DON'T have enough RAM** to allocate to the minikube virtual machine then try to put the maximum you have on your laptop.

## 1. Quick start with Istio

This task lets you quickly evaluate Istio.

Instructions - https://istio.io/docs/setup/getting-started/

Do everything until [Next steps](https://istio.io/docs/setup/getting-started/#next-steps) section.

**Results:**

- running [Bookinfo example application](https://istio.io/docs/examples/bookinfo/) and available at `http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage` (where $GATEWAY_URL - is the specific IP and PORT for every deployment)
- running [Kiali dashboard](https://kiali.io/) with an overview of your mesh with the relationships between the services

## 2. Request Routing

This task shows you how to route requests dynamically to multiple versions of a microservice.

Instructions - https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/request-routing/

**Results:**

- sending 100% of the traffic to the `v1` version of each of the Bookinfo services
- setting a rule to selectively send traffic to version `v2` of the reviews service based on a custom `end-user` header

## 3. Traffic Shifting (canary rollout)

This task shows you how to gradually migrate traffic from an older version to a new version.

Instructions - https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/traffic-shifting/

**Results:**

- migrating traffic from an old to new version of the `reviews` service using Istioâ€™s weighted routing feature
